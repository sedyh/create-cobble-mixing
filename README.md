When mining a cobblestone with a drill in Create, there is always a certain chance that the drop will fall not into the chute, but through the blocks around the digging area, even if the mechanism is closed from all sides in several layers. Also, a large number of such cobblestone generators will cause lags.

This is a lightweight way to get a cobblestone instead of drilling.


Unlike similar modifications, this is a regular datapack. 

If you can't use the datapack, then be sure to try this mod: [brandonusa/less-laggy-cobble-generation](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/less-laggy-cobble-generation).
